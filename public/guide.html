One of the main attractions in Mysore are all the majestic palaces.

Now, let’s dive into the bustling streets of Mysore. In the heart of the city is Krishna Rajendra Circle, also known as KR Circle. It is named after Maharaja Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV, one of the Wadiyar dynasty (See Wadiyar dynasty). Its main feature is a statue of the beloved Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV, after whom KR Circle is named. It is a popular gathering place during festivals like Dasara and Deepavali, and recently it was painted with radium infused paint to make it glow. KR Circle is one of the busiest places in Mysore. It’s always buzzing with sweet shops, sandalwood stalls, and dozens of street vendors adding to the active atmosphere.

The Wadiyar dynasty was founded by Yaduraya Wadiyar in 1399, who came to rule Mysore and was appointed by Harihara II. “Wadiyar” means “lord” in Kannada, which makes sense, since they ruled Mysore until 1950, when Mysore became part of the Indian Republic. This dynasty belonged to the Arasu Wadiyar community, known for its noble background. The Wadiyar dynasty initially ruled as vassals of the Vijayanagara Empire until its fall in 1565, where it became independent under Raja Wadiyar I, who moved the capital to Srirangapatna for strategic defense. Famous rulers like Kanthirava Narasaraja I and Chikka Devaraja expanded the kingdom and the Wadiyar’s rule and also improved administration. The current head of the family is Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar, adopted into the family in 2015. Even though the monarchy is no longer established, the Wadiyars are still treated with respect.
